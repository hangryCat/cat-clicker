# Objective
The goal was to create a page using mainly JavaScript. 
By creating the layout and functionality of the page using JavaScript and the DOM, I was able to keep my code DRY. 

# Try It Out
When you click an image of a cat, the default value of 0 should increment as well. 
The number of clicks shown in the cat area is unique to each cat.
Also, check out your console. Each cat's name should be printed along with a message saying its image was clicked.

# Reflection

At first, I thought it would be easier to just create the layout by writing it through the HTML file. 
However, I decided to choose 'the hard way'. Wanting to give up and just write everything on the HTML file happened multiple times, but I wanted to be able to do it this way. 
I knew it was more effective and will only help me become a better developer.

Trying to remember what I've learned online and googling on top of that helped. 
Midway through, I realized that once I get better at this, it would actually save a lot of time since I wouldn't need to create a ton of `divs` and what not over and over again in the HTML file.  

This code is definitely not the most effective way to do this, so if you have tips/tricks/advice, don't hesitate to let me know.
